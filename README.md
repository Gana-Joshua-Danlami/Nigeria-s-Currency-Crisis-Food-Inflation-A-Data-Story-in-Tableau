# Nigeria's-Currency-Crisis-Food-Inflation-A-Data-Story-in-Tableau
> A visual deep-dive into how Nigeriaâ€™s weakening currency and rising food inflation affect everyday life, built as part of my beginner data journey using real-world data and Tableau.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project started out of curiosity, a pain point, and ended as proof of growth.

At first, it was just me, a data analysis student at AltSchool Africa, trying to apply what I am learning into a real-life use case around what's going on in my immediate environment, out of wonder, i figured i could turn the chaos in Nigeriaâ€™s economy into a story I could understand with data.

This was my first time working on an independent project on my own, unlike the guided projects I am used to in school and on YouTube. I struggled for weeks. At one point, I wanted to give up, but my stubborn spirit couldn't relent until I finished what i started. I kept going back. Hooking. Resting. Vexing. Googling. Asking ChatGPT. Searching for resources on YouTube. Searching for help in the Tableau Public community. Failing. Trying again. Until I finally cracked it.

This project became a visual story of Nigeriaâ€™s **currency devaluation vs. food inflation**, built from scratch, no tutorial, no hand-holding. Just grit, curiosity, and a lot of grind to follow up till the end.

It wasnâ€™t perfect. But it was real. And for me, thatâ€™s the win.

I didn't do this to impress anybody. I did it to *prove to myself* that I could apply the skills i am learning and use it to tell stories around my immediate environment. 

This goes to my fellow new migrants into the tech ecosystem. If you're just starting out, let this show you whatâ€™s possible when you stick with the process. You don't need permission to build. Just start.

## ðŸŽ¯ Inspiration & Background

This project was inspired by real-life struggles of the average Nigerian, you can feel the economy squeezing people daily especially around food prices and the value of our currency. I kept seeing the headlines and tweets, but I wanted to *understand* the patterns beneath the noise.

Rather than just complain, I asked myself: *What if I could explain this story with data? What if I could visualize what we're feeling?*

Thatâ€™s what led me here, mixing my training as a data analyst with my storytellerâ€™s heart to capture the economic tension every Nigerian can relate to.

It became more than a project. It became a way for me to find clarity in the chaos, and show others whatâ€™s possible when you combine curiosity, storytelling, and the drive to grow.

## ðŸ§  Skills & Tools Used

This project wasnâ€™t just about charts, it was about rolling up my sleeves, experimenting, failing forward, and turning theory into real-world storytelling.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key tools and skills I leaned on:

- **ðŸ›  Tools & Platforms:**
  - `Google Colab` â€“ for data wrangling, cleanup, and exploratory analysis in Python
  - `Tableau Public` â€“ for building the final dashboard and telling the visual story
  - `ChatGPT` â€“ my debugging and ideation partner (it really held my hand through some frustrating moments)
  - `Google Sheets` â€“ quick data organization and version tracking
  - `YouTube & Tableau Community Forums` â€“ self-learning on the go

- **ðŸ“Š Core Skills Practiced:**
  - **Data Sourcing**: pulling raw, unstructured public datasets from multiple sources (CPI and exchange rate data)
  - **Data Cleaning**: merging, reshaping, and preparing messy data for analysis
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA): using basic stats, trend analysis, and logic to uncover the story within the data
  - **Data Visualization**: transforming cleaned data into digestible visuals with a focus on clarity and emotional impact
  - **Problem Solving & Persistence**: when things broke, I didnâ€™t quit. I found workarounds.

This wasnâ€™t about being perfect. It was about being *resourceful* taking limited tools and turning them into something amazing.

Every struggle sharpened a skill. Every error taught me something new. And every small win built my confidence.
